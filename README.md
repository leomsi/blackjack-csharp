Create a C# program where the user plays a game of BlackJack against the computer. The player and computer are initially dealt two cards from an unlimited deck. Random numbers will represent the cards from 1 to 10. After seeing their hand the player and the computer are given the opportunity to take additional cards. The computer should continue to take additional cards while less than 17. The hand that comes the closest to 21 without exceeding 21 wins the game. A draw results if both players have the same score. The program should include unit tests.

Here is the sample output from the program:

Your Cards: 5 7 = 12
Computers Cards : 4 5 = 9

Do you want another card (y/n)? y
Hit: 4 Your total is 16

Do you want another card (y/n)? y
Hit: 3 Your total is 19

Do you want another card (y/n)? n

The computer takes a card: 7 

The computer takes a card: 7

Your score: 19
Computer score: 23

You Won!

Please upload your program to a github repository and send the link.
